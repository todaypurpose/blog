We end up sometimes with some situations so absurd with people drinking the kool-aids, and starts being so frugal they also forget to live in order to get that early retirement.</p><p>An average person has a lifespan of 72 years. It might sound quite long, but in practise, how much of the 72 years can we truely use? I&rsquo;ll touch in this post about the 3 principles that, I believe, are keys to put into perspective to make the most of our life: <strong>Money</strong>, <strong>Free Time</strong> and <strong>Health</strong>. All 3 increase or decline the more we age. Most of us focus (too much / or only) on the <strong>money</strong> aspect. This is why we spend all our days working. <strong>Health</strong> and <strong>Free time</strong> are too often the forgotten ones. We assume money we accumulate during our young age will contribute to some sort of fullfilment when we will have plenty of free time when we will retire. Our society is actually designed around that timeline. But is it how we should live our life? What if once you retired, you don&rsquo;t have the necessary health to travel? What if you have an incident tomorrow?</p><h2 id=time-your-scarcest-and-most-precious-resource>Time, your scarcest and most precious resource</h2><p>A typical timeline of someone&rsquo;s life looks like:</p><ul><li>Under 25, we&rsquo;re getting into schools, have plenty of time playing around with friends. Our health is at it best. But we&rsquo;re usually low on money and depends on our parent&rsquo;s money</li><li>At 25, we get our first jobs, and start accumulating money. Now our time is usually stucked in our jobs. We&rsquo;re still really healthy and try to balance activities and work</li><li>At 40, we might start having this lower back or knee issues. We continue accumulating money, and our job is still what take the most of our attention</li><li>At 50, we continue accumulating money, and start thinking about retirement. However, we definitely know that our body aren&rsquo;t as great as in our 20s</li><li>At 65, we retired (ideally) with lot of cash. We have plenty on time on hands to do whatever we want. However, <em>our health has significantly declined</em> and we might not have as much motivation to do activities or see the world.</li></ul><p>In <a href=https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/52950915-die-with-zero>&ldquo;Die With Zero&rdquo;</a>, the hours and energy we are &ldquo;awake&rdquo; to do things is refered as <em><strong>&ldquo;Life Energy&rdquo;</strong></em>. There is just a limited amount of it. The main quesion is how do you spend that life energy? Is this life energy constant no matter our age?
<strong>From 18 to 40 is, in my humble opinion, the best years of our life.</strong>. Our health is at its peak. and we start making money, so can use it to do any kind of activities we wish. However with age, our health declines, and start seing its undesired effects starting our 40s (some might argue 30s). We start saying no because of [ back - knees - bones - etc ] conditions. One diagram that strucked with me was the <a href=https://waitbutwhy.com/2014/05/life-weeks.html>&ldquo;Life in weeks&rdquo; from &ldquo;Wait But Why&rdquo;</a>, where we can see weeks represented in squares. I&rsquo;ve adapted it to illustrate my point:</p><p><img src=https://todaypurpose.com/img/best-years-health.jpg alt="Best years - Health declining"></p><p>This diagram sumurizes show how much Free Time, Money, Health we have depending of our age:
<img src=https://todaypurpose.com/img/health-money-free-time.jpg alt="Health Money Free time change with age"></p><p>Thes <em>&ldquo;Best years of our life&rdquo;</em>, when our health is at its peak, and we can start to use our money is from 18 to 40, so <strong>22 years</strong>. For somone with a 9-5 job (or study), this is how time is split during those 22 years:</p><p><img src=https://todaypurpose.com/img/best-years-time-is-spent.png alt="How is your time spent during your best years?"></p><p>62,000 hours (33%) of our time is spent in bed. 50,000 hours (27%) is spent working and commuting. That leave us with <strong>57,000 hours when we could experience the world at our &ldquo;maximum&rdquo; potential</strong>.</p><p>Our <strong>Free Time is limited</strong>. Think twice before saying &ldquo;no&rdquo;, or delay an activity because of &ldquo;saving&rdquo; for the future when you&rsquo;ll probably can&rsquo;t do it.</p><ul><li>Try to sell your time on something you like, learn, or find meaningful</li><li>Don&rsquo;t work for &ldquo;assholes&rdquo;</li><li>The &ldquo;Autopilot&rdquo; mode</li><li>Buy some time with your money</li></ul><h2 id=money-is-aimed-to-be-spent>Money is aimed to be spent</h2><p>The (sad) truth in today&rsquo;s society is that money is needed to contribute to your hapiness. Even though some might argue that money isn&rsquo;t doesn&rsquo;t make you happy, it definitely contributes to hapiness, to fund a <strong>pleasant</strong>, <strong>engaging</strong> and <strong>meaningful</strong> life:
<img src=https://todaypurpose.com/img/money-contributes-to-hapiness.jpg alt="Money contributes to Hapiness"></p><p>As said earlier, we spent 1/3 of our &ldquo;career stage&rdquo; at work, and we do this mainly for money. The longer we work, the more skills we get, so the more money we make. However, our best years also happen during that career phase.</p><h3 id=whats-wrong-with-saving-too-much>What&rsquo;s wrong with saving too much?</h3><p>Most of people working think about making money to save for retirement.
