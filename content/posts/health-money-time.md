What would you do of your $1+ million dollar sitting in your bank account or index funds in your dying bed? 

There is something wrong with all those financial guru I keep seeing, they focus only on accumulating wealth, instead of what truely matters: hapiness.  We end up sometimes with some situations so absurd with people drinking the kool-aids, and starts being so frugal they also forget to live in order to get that early retirement.

An average person has a lifespan of 72 years. It might sound quite long, but in practise, how much of the 72 years can we truely use?  I'll touch in this post about the 3 principles that, I believe, are keys to put into perspective to make the most of our life: **Money**, **Free Time** and **Health**. All 3 increase or decline the more we age. Most of us focus (too much / or only) on the **money** aspect. This is why we spend all our days working. **Health** and **Free time** are too often the forgotten ones. We assume money we accumulate during our young age will contribute to some sort of fullfilment when we will have plenty of free time when we will retire. Our society is actually designed around that timeline. But is it how we should live our life? What if once you retired, you don't have the necessary health to travel? What if you have an incident tomorrow?

## Time, your scarcest and most precious resource

A typical timeline of someone's life looks like: 

- Under 25, we're getting into schools, have plenty of time playing around with friends. Our health is at it best. But we're usually low on money and depends on our parent's money
- At 25, we get our first jobs, and start accumulating money. Now our time is usually stucked in our jobs. We're still really healthy and try to balance activities and work     
- At 40, we might start having this lower back or knee issues. We continue accumulating money, and our job is still what take the most of our attention
- At 50, we continue accumulating money, and start thinking about retirement. However, we definitely know that our body aren't as great as in our 20s
- At 65, we retired (ideally) with lot of cash. We have plenty on time on hands to do whatever we want. However, *our health has significantly declined* and we might not have as much motivation to do activities or see the world. 

In ["Die With Zero"](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/52950915-die-with-zero), the hours and energy we are "awake" to do things is refered as _**"Life Energy"**_. There is just a limited amount of it. The main quesion is how do you spend that life energy? Is this life energy constant no matter our age? 
**From 18 to 40 is, in my humble opinion, the best years of our life.**. Our health is at its peak. and we start making money, so can use it to do any kind of activities we wish. However with age, our health declines, and start seing its undesired effects starting our 40s (some might argue 30s). We start saying no because of [ back - knees - bones - etc ] conditions. One diagram that strucked with me was the ["Life in weeks" from "Wait But Why"](https://waitbutwhy.com/2014/05/life-weeks.html), where we can see weeks represented in squares. I've adapted it to illustrate my point: 

![Best years - Health declining](/img/best-years-health.jpg)

This diagram sumurizes show how much Free Time, Money, Health we have depending of our age:
![Health Money Free time change with age](/img/health-money-free-time.jpg)

The _"best years of our life"_, when our health is at its peak, and we can start to use our money is from 18 to 40, so **22 years**. For somone with a 9-5 job (or study), this is how time is split during those 22 years: 

![How is your time spent during your best years?](/img/best-years-time-is-spent.png)

62,000 hours (33%) of our time is spent in bed. 50,000 hours (27%) is spent working and commuting.  That leave us with **57,000 hours when we could experience the world at our "maximum" potential**.


Our **Free Time is limited**. Think twice before saying "no", or delay an activity because of "saving" for the future when you'll probably can't do it.

- Try to sell your time on something you like, learn, or find meaningful
- Don't work for "assholes"
- The "Autopilot" mode
- Buy some time with your money


## Spending Money as soon as possible (in the right things)

The (sad) truth in today's society is that money is needed to contribute to your hapiness. Even though some might argue that money isn't doesn't make you happy, it definitely contributes to hapiness, to fund a **pleasant**, **engaging** and **meaningful** life:

### What's wrong with saving too much?

Most of people working think about making money to save for retirement. When time comes, that money will be used for enjoying life they'll have more free time. It also exists now many [F.I.R.E](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/FIRE_movement) (early retirement) gurus that keeps talking about living frugally to a point where you sacrifice social life, family and friends. It is true that investing early will make a difference with the amount of money you'll end up with in 30+ years, but who guarantee you that you'll live until then? Even if you reach that stage, what will we do with this million dollars saved/invested when I'll lay in my hospital bed? Will your physical condition at 50+ years old will allow you doing the same type of activities as your 30s?

**Money exists to be spent**. You'll never regret into **spending money into experiences or things that can create memories** (either good or bad). They add a lot into fulfilling your life and shape the way we are: 
![Life Experiences](/img/life-experiences.jpg)

It is also true that we don't necessarly need money to make memories. Under our 25, we're incredibly good at finding ways to get things for free. But the more we move in our age, the more we can unlock some of the experience that can be accessed with money.

You'll get the most benefit of it the earlier you spend it. One of the benefit in spending it early is that activities, and we keep thinking and talking about them. I also believe it's. 

![Memory compounding from experiences](/img/memory-compunding.jpg)

As said earlier, we spend 1/3 of our "career stage" at work, and we do this mainly for money. The longer we work, the more skills we get, so the more money we make. However, our best years also happen during that career phase, and this is when we can get the most of the experiences that will invevitably compound in time. Do you want spend all your career phase and missing out in all the experiences you can get when you're young and healthy? It exists some solutions to allocate better our time during that phase, such as starting our own company, [early retirement](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/f/financial-independence-retire-early-fire.asp), getting better paychecks (or [more as a contractor](https://training.kalzumeus.com/newsletters/archive/consulting_1)), or working for companies with [4 days work week](https://4dayweek.io?ref=todaypurpose.com). 


### What's wrong with saving too little?

**You don't want to end up old and poor**. There is also a balance to find between spending money and saving money. There is a limit into where you should spend your money, and everyone has a different limit depending of our income. Generally speaking, spending your money every year into the latest Iphone, defaulting to 5 stars hotel, or business class tickets isn't the best use of your money. Unless occasionally, they won't bring you much value in our life (exept for external validation). This is where I usually start saying no, and invest that extra money for my future self: 

- Make that extra money _work for you_. Invest into diversified index funds so you can use the [power of compound interest](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/c/compoundinterest.asp#growth-of-compound-interest), and use that "free money" later on the late stage of your life. The [earlier you invest, the better it is](https://ofdollarsanddata.com/go-big-then-stop/?ref=todaypurpose.com).
- You will also want to have a an emergency funds (6 months of expenses in in your bank account) that can be used as a buffer in case of losing job, unecpected bill, injury, etc...

_Find your balance between investing your money for the future , and spending on what matters (memories) in the present._


## Health, our most precious gift

Health inevitably declines with age, and we can't do antyhing about it (yet). Our life energy will decrease with age, but it doesn't mean  we should fatally wait for our last days. Would you prefer having lot of health issues, being overweight when getting in your 50-60? Or would you rather? 

It is never too late to start. The time you're spending 

, you'll not be able to recover your past health.

- Working out to 
- Eat 
- Sleep
- Staying healthy is probably the best gift you can give to your kids (more than giving them inheritance).



Being overweighted . Being weak isn't great either. Can you follow to hike ? 

Health, free time, money 

Experiences, real friends, meaningful contributions


Of course getting all three aren't enough to get a happy life. Why rich billionaire end up suiciding
