Life isn't just about how long we live; it's about how well we live it. We often hear about increasing our lifespan, but is a longer life worth it if we can't move and become dependent on others? What's equally, or even more important, is enhancing our healthspan—the period during which we enjoy a good quality of life. From what I've observed when talking to older people, they care more about "improving the quality of their life" than "living a longer life" 

Imagine being unable to engage in activities you love, like traveling, playing with kids, hiking, or even just gardening. The loss of functional ability can lead to a diminished the enjoyment we have in life. 

What can you do to maintain your independence, relationships, and **dignity**?  I believe the answer lies in working out, especially **resistance training** that helps keeping our strength. In his book ["Outlive"](https://peterattiamd.com/outlive/), Peter Attia shows how we can increase our healthpan and combat the effect of aging :

> "Exercise is by far the most potent longevity ‘drug’ available." It's not just about delaying death; it's about preserving cognitive and physical abilities.

## The inevitable decline begins in your 30s

Many of us don't notice it in our 20s, but as we enter our 30s, the signs become more and more reccurent. Recovery from injuries slows down, we get tired more quickly, and our overall vigor starts to wane. 

### sarcopenia: losing muscle and strenght as we age

Sarcopenia is the loss of muscle strength with age. It often catches people off guard and people realize it when it's too late. Starting as early as age 30, we begin to lose 3% to 5% of our muscle mass each decade. By the end of a typical lifespan, most individuals have lost about 30% of their muscle strength.
Preserving muscle mass is crucial. **No amount of cardio** (running, cycling) can combat this natural decline.  Both men and women need to engage in strength training along with cardiovascular exercise.

## Resistance Training: The ultimate drug to improve healthspan

The graph show than our peak strength happen at 30 and start decreasing over time:

This other graph show the effect of resistance training, and how it can prevent disability:

Without resistance training, our bodies undergo a transformation post-30: muscle loss gives way to a higher fat percentage, leading to a weaker physique and the lose of autonomy.

### reducing the risk of injuries and falls

Falls are a leading cause of mortality for people over 75. Resistance training enhances lower body strength, crucial for activities like climbing stairs or simply standing up from a chair. Stronger muscles also mean better balance and a reduced risk of falls, which can be catastrophic in later life. Starting 60-65: risk of falls that lead to immediate death or within 12 months (break hips / femur) is really high (15-30% depending the study). [Over 14 million, or 1 in 4 older adults report falling every year](https://www.cdc.gov/falls/data/). It is also the leading cause on the non-fatal injuries in the USA at all ages :

### a 20-year advantage

[Research](https://www.nsca.com/contentassets/2a4112fb355a4a48853bbafbe070fb8e/resistance_training_for_older_adults__position.1.pdf) shows that 85-year-old individuals who have consistently engaged in weightlifting display similar physical power to non-lifting 65-year-olds. Long-term resistance training can grant an approximate 20-year advantage in physical capabilities.


### avoiding pains

If you are in your 30s like me, you probably already feel it.  Regular exercise, especially strength training, plays a vital role in pain prevention and management. Weak muscles and a sedentary lifestyle often lead to chronic pain issues, which can severely impact the quality of life in our later years.


## Other reasons to stay strong as we age?

### cognitive benefits

Resistance training doesn't just benefit the body; it also supports cognitive health. Low muscle mass and physical inactivity are linked to cognitive decline in old age. Exercise releases myokines, which support brain health, indicating a dose-dependent effect between muscle mass and cognitive function.


### independance, autonomy

As we lost strenght we will lose ability to grab things, or even walk. This might lead to Keeping some dignity as a huma being. 
The ability to engage in activities like playing with kids, hiking, or traveling is not just a matter of physical capability; it's also about maintaining independence and relationships, which are central to happiness. As we age, the desire to remain self-reliant grows stronger, and resistance training plays a crucial role in this.


### keeping relationships

Strength directly influences our ability to maintain social connections. If our mobility decreases, so does the ability to visit friends and family, which can lead to isolation and loneliness. 

Staying strong and mobile enables us to actively participate in social activities, maintaining and nurturing relationships that are essential for mental and emotional well-being.

Staying healthy is probably the best gift we can give to our children. As we become more dependent due to health issues, we not only incur significant healthcare costs but also potentially place a financial and emotional burden on our families.

### reducing risk of cancer and heart disease: 

Resistance training can lead from **10 to 20 percent reduction** in the risk of early death from all causes and from cancer and heart disease. https://bjsm.bmj.com/content/56/13/755 


### staying fit by doing "nothing"
Friends usually ask me how I can stay fit by eating that much I believe I have and advantage I've been building since I was 10ish: I kept working out. I've built muscle over the years, and my **resting metabolic rate** . Lean muscle burns more calories than fat, even at rest. Having more muscle is a kind of cheat code.  By increasing muscle mass your resting metabolic rate goes up. It means that [you can burn more calories when you are at rest]((https://www.researchgate.net/figure/Relationship-between-BMR-and-lean-body-mass_fig1_5440088)):

![resting metabolic rate vs muscle](/img/working-out/resting-metabolic-rate-vs-lean-muscle.png)

Of course you'll need to preserve those muscle with resistance training.


## Conclusion

Resistance training is a choice you make, for yourself in the future It is never too late to start. The benefits of doing it can be seen at any age. The key is to keep doing it. The CDC recommends [2+ days per week that work all major muscle groups (legs, hips, back, abdomen, chest, shoulders, and arms)](https://www.cdc.gov/physicalactivity/basics/age-chart.html). There is plenty of streght traiing gurus out there. No matter which one you pick, you'll find benefits any of them. 

My only advice is to find good lasting reasons to workout (I hope this article helped) and stop finding excuses to not go.
