I'm an engineer. I work with startups, and enjoy working on my own projects. I currently make 6 figures a year. 

Lived in Europe, worked for some US companies and startups. I currently live somwehere in Asia. 

I come from a modest family, and now enjoying what some might consider an "enriching life".

If you're intested in my point of view, I invite you to subscribe to my newsletter. No spam, only what you'd expect from a great newsletter. Topics will include **money**, mental or physical **health**, and reflections how one is using its **life**.
