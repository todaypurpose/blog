I'm an engineer. Lived in Europe, worked for some US startups and currently live somwehere in Asia.
I usually work in startups, but also enjoy working on my own projects. Coming from a modest family, I feel really lucky to be able to make 6 figures a year.

If you're intested in my point of view, I invite you to subscribe to my newsletter. Topics will include **money**, mental or physical **health**, and reflections how one is using its **life**.  No spam, only what you'd expect from a great newsletter.
