In my 30's. Lived in Europe, US, and now somwehere in Asia. I usually work in startup and my own projects. Coming from a modest family, I feel really lucky to now do well financially, while keeping a good work life balance.

If you're intested in my point of view, I invite you to subscribe to my newsletter. Topics will include **money**, mental or physical **health**, and reflections how one use its **life**.  No spam, only what you'd expect from a great newsletter.
